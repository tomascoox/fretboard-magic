# FretHunt User Manual & Logic Overview

## Core Concept: Custom Selection
In the new FretHunt design, **Custom Selection** is the single source of truth for the Memory Game.
Instead of presets and manual selections being separate modes, they all feed into one unified state: `customSelectedNotes`.

## Dashboard Controls
The dashboard is now permanently visible when the game is not active (Idle Mode).

### 1. Note Selector (Dropdown)
- **Function:** Adds *all instances* of a specific note (e.g., "A", "C#") to the selection.
- **Logic:** Scans all fretboard positions (up to fret 22) on allowed strings. If a note matches, it's added to `customSelectedNotes`.
- **Use Case:** "I want to practice all 'A' notes on the neck."

### 2. Manual Selection Toggle ("CUSTOM SELECT")
- **Function:** Enables direct interaction with the fretboard visuals.
- **Active State (Green):** Clicking a note on the fretboard toggles it (adds/removes it from `customSelectedNotes`).
- **Inactive State (Purple):** Clicking a note plays its sound (Play Mode).
- **Important:** Toggling this mode DOES NOT hide the dashboard anymore. You can mix and match dropdown selections with manual clicks.

### 3. Presets
- **NATURALS:** Selects all natural notes (no sharps/flats).
- **User Presets:** Loads a saved set of notes.
- **Logic:** Presets *overwrite* the current selection completely.

### 4. String Filter
- **Function:** Filters which strings are active for the Dropdown and Game Logic.
- **Persisted:** Allowed strings are saved to LocalStorage.

## Game Logic
- **Start Hunt:** Before starting, the game checks if `customSelectedNotes` has any notes.
- **Safety:** If no notes are selected, the game stops immediately with "NO NOTES SELECTED!".
- **Pie Menu:** During the game, the guessing wheel (Pie Menu) automatically filters itself. It only shows chart slices for notes that are actually present in your current selection. (e.g., if you only selected "E", only the "E" slice is colored blue).

## Troubleshooting
- **"Ghost Notes" (Blue Open Strings):** Fixed by removing legacy `isMenuPreview` logic that defaulted to showing all open strings.
- **"Dashboard Disappeared":** Fixed by removing conditional rendering wrappers. The dashboard is now a permanent fixture in Idle Mode.
